				<h2>Ryan talking bout his childhood</h2>
				<p>On November 12, 1980, little Ryan Gosling was born in Ontario, Canada., His father was a salesman and his mother a secretary, and although his family was Mormon, the future actor remembers that he had no interest in practicing these beliefs: “I was not Mormon, my parents were. My mother was very smart, she told me that religion was an option, but not the only one, and that I had to find my own truth. However, the importance his family attached to religious worship made the boy develop an exposition. with whom he felt comfortable, as he once recalled: “There was something nice about going to church and socializing about being such a boy. Praying in public, greeting older people Doing things, speaking in front of small crowds, singing in churches, and so on. Some of them have always stayed with me.” Since he was a child, he knew that he wanted to be an actor and this inspired him to try his luck in different castings. Ryan was not afraid of the public and was firm in his decision, encouraging him to appear for a trial for a children’s television show, Mickey Mouse Club, In this way, the little boy who was the real earthquake at school breaks into the world’s friendliest rat house.</p>

				<h2>AUTISTIC RYAN GOSLING ON ICONIC DRIVE: THIS IS MY SUPERHERO MOVIE</h2>
				<p>I could relate to that because back when I was a kid, when I first saw First Blood, it kind of put a spell on me and I thought I was Rambo. I went to school the next day and I put all these knives in my Fisher-Price Houdini kit and I f**king threw them at all these kids at recess, and I got suspended. I didn’t hit any kids and I didn’t hurt anybody, thank god, but my parents were like, “You can’t watch violent movies anymore.” They were careful about what they showed me because [movies] really did have a big impact on me. They said I could only watch Bible movies and National Geographic films, but those are really f**king violent, you know [laughs] — but I could see where they were going.</p>

				<h2>Dead Man's Bones - Music career of Ryan Gosling</h2>
				<p>The highlight of the album is undoubted ‘Pa Pa Power’, which has just reentered the collective consciousness after Cat Power covered it. It’s catchy, introspective and features that incredibly ’80s synth line, which helps to confirm that in many ways, it was the children in Gosling and Shields that were writing the album. The most interesting element of the record is that it had a great impact on the most unlikely of people. The record was cited as an inspiration by extreme/black metal pioneers, Behemoth on their acclaimed 2018 album I Loved You At Your Darkest. “I stole that idea from Ryan Gosling — I don’t know if you know that actor. Not only is he a great actor, he’s also a great musician,” Behemoth frontman Nergal told Metalshop when discussing the idea to utilise the collective voices of children.</p>
